# Touch Screen Calibration Based on Using Beam Projector

1) This research aims to calibrate the virtually projected touch screen(wall) by pointing 9 coordinates.
2) Developed three different mathematical algorithms to calibrate virtual touch screen projected by beam projector where reflective bar, laser sensor, and optic module are given
3) Built a test-bed for system evaluation by using C\#, Python, and Raspberry Pi
